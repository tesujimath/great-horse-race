The Great Horse Race, copyright (c) 2005 Simon J. Guest.

See license.txt for the license.

GreatHorseRace.hs is the source code, in the Haskell programming
language.  In case it's new to you, Haskell is a rather wonderful
programming language, which you can learn a little more about here :-
http://www.haskell.org/tutorial

To build it from source, you need :-

1. Glasgow Haskell Compiler, http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

2. wxHaskell, http://wxhaskell.sourceforge.net/

The source code builds and runs on both Linux and Windows.
Linux is my preferred development platform, and for some reason, the
program runs faster under Linux.  (Races of length 1000 are a little
slow under Windows;  perhaps you should switch to Linux ;-)

To run it, you need the wxHaskell DLL, which is included.  This is an
unmodified version of the library which you can download from the
wxHaskell site, where you can get the source code.  It is included
here for convenience only.
